# Data Science Job Family Salary Analysis

## Introduction

### Background

In 2021, Harvard Business Review published an article titled _Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century_. Within this article, the main topics discussed were how big data jobs and jobs within that job family will have a boom and increase in demand due to how corporations see them as valuable assets when it comes to making business decisions. Through reading this article, I wanted to conduct a personal study/project about the job family by using data on salaries given to the job family. Through this study, I wanted to deduce what kind of factors affected their salary such as company size and level of remoteness.
